# FastFood-Guru

FastFood-Guru is my second project, and took me quite a while to complete, as it was a bit more challenging than the first one. After learning about the fundamentals of full stack applications in my first project, I wanted to deepen my knowledge of Spring, while improving my frontend skills as well.


The application lets a user search for (with TypeAhead), read and write funny reviews about their favorite fast-food chains. The user has the ability to create an account, which then allows them to write and submit their own reviews.


The backend is an API built with Spring Boot, and Maven as the build tool. The database was created with MySQL, and then connected to the Spring Boot application. This RESTful API is also secured with JSON Web Tokens, using Spring Security.

The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and AngularJS as the chosen Javascript library.

Challenges: Implementing the authentication system in the backend as well as the frontend, learning AngularJS
